1. Introduction
	pgen is a packet generator tool. Useful for creating various kinds
network packets based on a user passed configuration file. pgen builds packet
from ether-header itself and it uses a RAW socket to send the packet. So you
need to posses root priviledge to use pgen.

	pgen is a stand-alone binary. As of now it doesn't depend on any library
other than glibc. And in future also we will work harder to achieve this.

	pgen is released under GNU-GPLv3 license. You are free to access, edit,
modify, re-distribute the code without any prior permission from the author.
But anyway kindly inform the author if you do so.

2. How to Use
	Run make to create the binary. And without installing simply use the binary

	# make

	The user generated configuration file, which contains the data using which
pgen should construct packet will be given to pgen as a command-line argument.
Or if the user didn't give any configuration file through command-line, pgen
will try to use /etc/pgen.conf file by default.

	# ./pgen conf

	Read conf.help file to know more about configuration file.

3. About me
	I'm a network engineer for past two years. I developed this tool, because
I need it personally.

	You could mail me at "kumaran.4353@gmail.com". I'm happy to hear you.

	I need contributors for this program. Till now I am the only developer
of this project. But I believe, this will change soon.
